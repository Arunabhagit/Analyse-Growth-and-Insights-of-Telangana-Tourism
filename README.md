# Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing the growth and development of Telangana's tourism sector. Tourism plays a vital role in the state's economy, and this analysis aims to uncover trends and patterns that reflect its progress. The core objective is to evaluate the performance of various tourist spots across Telangana by studying annual data on both domestic and foreign visitors.

By examining visitor inflow year by year, the project will highlight the most popular destinations, track emerging tourist attractions, and identify potential hotspots that are gaining popularity. A comparison between domestic and international tourism will provide insights into the diversity of the tourist base and help understand visitor preferences.

Additionally, the project will include a predictive analysis to estimate future trends and project potential revenue from tourism for the upcoming year. This forward-looking perspective will assist stakeholders in strategic planning and decision-making. The analysis will be supported by data visualization and statistical techniques to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the tourism growth in Telangana. Ultimately, the project aims to contribute valuable insights that can support sustainable tourism development in the state.

# Describe The Data

For this project, I collected tourism data from all 34 districts of Telangana, covering the years 2016 to 2019. The data includes daily records of both domestic and foreign tourists. Initially, I had eight separate CSV filesâ€”four for domestic tourists and four for foreign tourists, each corresponding to one year. To streamline the analysis, I merged all these datasets into a single CSV file, allowing for a comprehensive and unified view of tourism trends over the four-year period.

# Tools Used

For this project, I utilized several tools to perform comprehensive analysis and generate meaningful insights. I used PostgreSQL to execute SQL queries for data exploration, pattern identification, and calculations such as the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of visitors and the ratio between domestic and foreign tourists.

In addition, I used Python for deeper analysis, including identifying monthly and daily visitor patterns, and analyzing district-wise growth trends.

To visualize insights effectively, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard. This dashboard presents analyses such as day-wise and year-wise visitor trends, highlights the best and worst performing districts, and includes future projections to estimate potential visitors and expected tourism revenue.
