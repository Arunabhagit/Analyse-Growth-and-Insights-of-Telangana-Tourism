![telangana_tourism](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dac000d3-3a90-49af-825c-e4f05e96026a)

# Introduction
This project analyzes the growth and development of Telangana’s tourism sector, which significantly contributes to the state’s economy. By studying annual data on domestic and foreign visitors, it aims to evaluate the performance of key tourist destinations, identify popular and emerging attractions, and uncover patterns in visitor inflow. A comparative analysis between domestic and international tourism will offer insights into visitor preferences. The project also includes predictive analysis to estimate future trends and potential tourism revenue. Supported by data visualization and statistical techniques, the findings will assist in strategic planning and promote sustainable tourism development in Telangana.

# Describe The Data

For this project, I collected tourism data from all 34 districts of Telangana, covering the years 2016 to 2019. The data includes daily records of both domestic and foreign tourists. Initially, I had eight separate CSV files—four for domestic tourists and four for foreign tourists, each corresponding to one year. To streamline the analysis, I merged all these datasets into a single CSV file, allowing for a comprehensive and unified view of tourism trends over the four-year period.

# Objective 

The primary objective of this project is to comprehensively analyze the growth and development of the tourism sector in Telangana. By examining year-wise data on domestic and foreign tourist arrivals, the project seeks to evaluate the performance of various tourist destinations across the state. This analysis will help identify the most popular tourist spots, monitor emerging attractions, and uncover potential hotspots that are gaining visitor interest.

Another key objective is to distinguish patterns between domestic and international tourist inflow, which will offer insights into the diversity of the visitor base and their preferences. This comparative study aims to reveal the dynamics of regional versus global appeal in Telangana’s tourism landscape.

Additionally, the project aims to apply predictive analysis techniques to forecast future trends in visitor numbers and potential revenue from tourism. These forecasts are intended to aid policymakers and tourism stakeholders in strategic planning and resource allocation. Through the use of statistical methods and data visualization tools, the project strives to deliver actionable insights that support evidence-based decision-making and promote sustainable tourism development in Telangana.

# Insights from the Analysis:

**Stable Tourism Base:**  Despite minor fluctuations due to holidays, closures, or weather, Telangana maintains a steady average of ~120,000 visitors annually, indicating a strong and consistent tourism interest.

**Monthly Visitor Trends:** February attracts the highest footfall due to pleasant weather.June sees a rise due to monsoon season and school holidays. December, though traditionally a peak month elsewhere, shows a dip likely due to colder nights and changing travel behaviors.

**Domestic vs. Foreign Visitors:** 99% of tourists are domestic, averaging ~89 million annually from 2016–2019.Foreign visitors are minimal but growing, reaching 323,000+ in 2019, showing increasing global interest.

**Top Performing Districts:** Hyderabad is the leading district, with the highest number of both domestic and international visitors.Warangal (Urban) and Rajanna Sircilla are rapidly emerging domestic tourism hubs.Karimnagar shows the highest CAGR due to cultural and infrastructural development.

**Visitor Ratios:** Districts like Nirmal and Jangaon are highly dependent on domestic tourists.Hyderabad exhibits a balanced ratio, reflecting its global appeal.

**Projected Growth:** From 2025–2030, visitor numbers are expected to rise steadily, especially after 2027.A 3–4% surge is anticipated between 2028–2029, with revenue projections increasing proportionally.

# Strategic Decisions & Recommendations:

**Boost Off-Season Tourism:** Develop events and campaigns for December to convert it into a high-traffic month.

**Enhance International Tourism:** Improve facilities in Hyderabad by investing in premium accommodations, international cuisine, and cultural programs to cater to foreign tourists.

**Promote High-Potential Districts:** Support Rajanna Sircilla, Warangal, and Yadadri Bhuvanagiri through cultural festivals and temple tourism promotions during key seasons.

**Infrastructure Development:** Identify low-performing districts with weak infrastructure and prioritize them for redevelopment and cleanliness drives.

**Data-Driven Feedback:** Conduct monthly tourist surveys to gather actionable feedback and refine infrastructure or services accordingly.

**Leverage Social Media:** Promote destinations through YouTube, Instagram, and Facebook, using vlogs and regular content to enhance digital presence.

**Future Planning:** Use visitor and revenue projections to set realistic growth targets.Encourage public and private investment in emerging tourism districts to create jobs and boost local economies.

This project has taught me a great deal—from creating statistical charts to extracting meaningful insights, it has been a long and enriching journey. I worked through handling missing data, merging multiple tables, and performing analysis using SQL and Python. The data was then visualized effectively using Power BI. The main objective of the project was to support the Telangana Tourism Department in enhancing their tourism strategy on a larger scale. This work wouldn’t have been possible without the guidance of tutorials I followed. The central analytical focus was on "what" and "how"—understanding what insights the data provides and how to use them for improvement. The insights reveal past trends and performance, while the “how” guides us in making realistic predictions for the future. Instead of using linear regression, I relied on assumptions that felt more practical and applicable. This project is open to all, and for any queries or discrepancies, feel free to contact me via LinkedIn.
